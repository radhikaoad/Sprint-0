### Appointment Scheduling System
### Team Members: Rayyan, Lucas, Edwin, Radhika
### We were tasked with creating an application to help businesses manage their appointments.  We designed and implemented different coding practices to create our program and developed an application that is able to store the location, attendees and time/date of an appointment and display that information.
